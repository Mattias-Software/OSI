# Description
## 3Com Etherlink II 2227-04 REV A:
It is a 8-bit ISA ethernet card made by 3Com. The card features an AUI and a BNC connector as well as a 8 kilobytes of ram and a socket for installing an EPROM

_Note: I wasn't able to find the datasheet provided by the same manifactuerer of the SRAM IC (srm2264l). I found a datasheet of the same IC but from anothe brand. I suspect that, while being mostly compatible, the IC described in the datasheet is slightly different.
For instance, pin 1 is reported as NC but on the card is actually connected to the "main" ASIC; therefore I came to the conclusion that that pin must have a function on the IC that is present on the card._
