# Open Schematic Initiative

OSI (Open Schematic Initiative) is a project that aims to provide schematics that I create as a hobby of random PCBs I buy from flee markets.





## Disclaimer

I am an hobbyist, I have no prior kownledge in EE. Thus, as much effort I put in this schematic and, although, I keep expanindg my kownledge, these schematics will never have the same quality as a schematic made by a professional, therefore these schematics are provieded ***AS IS***.

***THESE SCHEMATICS ARE MADE FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY***
